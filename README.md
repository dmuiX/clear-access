# clear-access

**Clear access to all your tools.**

I set up a clear, central way to access your tools — self-hosted and SaaS.  
Your team signs in with the company account they already use.

**No rebuild. No big project.**

👉 **Live page:** https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO>/

## What this is

Most teams don’t have a clear access state.

- Every tool has its own login  
- Access grew over time  
- It’s unclear who still has access to what  
- Offboarding is slow and error-prone  

**clear-access** fixes the *access layer* — not the tools themselves.

---

## What I set up

- One central entry point for your tools  
- One company login (Microsoft, Google, or on-prem)  
- Clear rules for who can reach which tool  
- Optional network-level protection  

Your applications stay exactly as they are.

## A simple principle

> Access is managed in one place.  
> What happens inside each tool stays inside that tool.

---

## Good fit if

- you use several tools (self-hosted and/or SaaS)
- you want one company login
- you want a clear overview of access again
- you want clarity without a long project

## Not a fit if

- you want to reorganize every system at once
- you’re looking for a full IAM program
- you expect ongoing operations

---

## System integrators

This is also useful for **system integrators** who want to give customers clean access  
without turning it into an IAM project.

## Next step

A short call is enough to see whether this fits.  
If yes: a clearly scoped project.  
If not: an honest “no”.
