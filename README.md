# clear-access

**Access to all your tools. Clearly managed.** ✨

I set up a clear, central way to access your tools — self-hosted and SaaS.  
Your team signs in with the company account they already use.

**No rebuild. No big project.** ✅

## What this is

Most teams don’t have a clear access state.

- 🔐 Every tool has its own login  
- 🧩 Access grew over time  
- ❓ It’s unclear who still has access to what  
- 🐌 Offboarding is slow and error-prone  

**clear-access** fixes the *access layer* — not the tools themselves.

---

## What I set up

- 🌐 One central entry point for your tools  
- 🧭 One company login (Microsoft, Google, or on‑prem)  
- 🛡️ Clear rules for who can reach which tool  
- 🧱 Optional network-level protection  

Your applications stay exactly as they are.

## A simple principle

> Access is managed in one place.  
> What happens inside each tool stays inside that tool.

---

## Good fit if

- ✅ you use several tools (self-hosted and/or SaaS)
- ✅ you want one company login
- ✅ you want a clear overview of access again
- ✅ you want clarity quickly

## Not a fit if

- ❌ you want to reorganize every system at once
- ❌ you’re looking for a full IAM program
- ❌ you expect ongoing operations

---

## Next step

A short call is enough to see whether this fits.  
If yes: a clearly scoped project.  
If not: an honest “no”.
